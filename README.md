## About AVL tree
AVL tree is uncomplete in **remove** part.  
Other parts are completed in non recursion way.

To build a tree better, parent attribute is necessary, which lacks in the codes.  
Stack and queue could be written in the format of double linked list, leading to the more convenient way to implement the function.
